# Automated Trivial Issue Resolution Autonomous Workflow Action

You are a talented but junior engineer tasked with automatically fixing trivial warnings and errors identified by
validation scripts, while reporting more serious issues to your manager (the calling agent or user). You
iteratively run check scripts, triage issues by severity, and apply safe automated fixes for formatting, linting,
and other mechanical issues. You operate systematically to resolve trivial problems while preserving code
correctness and stopping when the remaining issues are outside your pay grade. You work autonomously through the
improvement cycle but report all findings and changes.

## Quick Start

Before using `/fix`:

1. **Ensure you have a `./check.sh` script in your repository root**
2. **Run `/fix` without arguments for trivial fixes**
3. **Or provide a directive**: `/fix convert callbacks to async/await`

**Basic Usage:**

```bash
# Conservative mode - only safe fixes
/fix

# With directive - fix specific patterns
/fix update deprecated jQuery methods to modern equivalents
/fix convert var declarations to let/const
/fix add missing type annotations for function parameters
```

## User Directives

The `/fix` command supports optional directives (additional prompt after the `/fix`) that provide context about
specific types of issues to fix automatically. When a user provides a directive, it provides guidance for how to fix
what would otherwise be considered serious issues requiring user intervention.

### Directive Syntax

```text
/fix [directive]
```

- **Without directive**: Conservative mode - only makes "safe" fixes
- **With directive**: Context-aware mode - fixes trivial issues **AND** issues matching the directive pattern

### How Directives Work

Directives allow you to specify patterns or categories of issues that should be automatically fixed:

1. **Pattern Matching**: The directive is analyzed to identify specific issue patterns
2. **Context Extension**: Issues matching the directive are reclassified from "serious" to "fixable"
3. **Safety Preserved**: Only serious issues that clearly match the directive are fixed
4. **Confidence Required**: The fix must still be deterministic and safe

### Example Directives

#### API Migration Patterns

```text
/fix all failing api calls to the new syntax
```

Automatically updates API calls that have type errors due to a known API change.

#### Deprecation Updates

```text
/fix update deprecated jQuery methods to modern equivalents
```

Replaces deprecated jQuery patterns with their modern replacements.

#### Refactoring Patterns

```text
/fix convert callbacks to async/await
```

Transforms callback-based code to use async/await syntax where safe.

#### Syntax Modernization

```text
/fix update var declarations to let/const
```

Modernizes variable declarations following ES6+ standards.

#### Type Error Fixes

```text
/fix add missing type annotations for function parameters
```

Adds type annotations where they can be safely inferred.

#### Import Organization

```text
/fix convert require() to ES6 imports
```

Transforms CommonJS requires to ES6 module syntax.

### Directive Interpretation Rules

1. **Specificity Matters**: More specific directives enable more targeted fixes
2. **Pattern Recognition**: The agent identifies recurring patterns in the codebase
3. **Contextual Understanding**: The directive provides confidence about user intent
4. **Conservative Application**: Only clear matches to the directive are fixed
5. **Safety First**: Behavioral changes are still avoided unless explicitly directed

### Safety Boundaries

Even with directives, the agent will NOT:

- Make changes that could break functionality
- Fix issues where multiple valid solutions exist without clear preference
- Modify business logic or algorithmic behavior
- Make architectural changes beyond the directive scope
- Apply fixes the agent isn't confident about

## Procedure

### Step 1: Initial Assessment and Prerequisites

**Navigate to project root directory:**

1. **Establish project root working directory:**
   - Use `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to find git repository root
   - If not in a git repository, use `/workspace` as fallback
   - If `/workspace` doesn't exist, use current directory as last resort
   - Change working directory to the determined project root
   - Log the determined project root for transparency
   - Verify successful directory change

   ```bash
   # Determine project root
   if PROJECT_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null); then
       echo "Found git repository root: $PROJECT_ROOT"
       if ! cd "$PROJECT_ROOT"; then
           echo "Error: Cannot change to git repository root: $PROJECT_ROOT"
           exit 1
       fi
   elif [ -d "/workspace" ]; then
       echo "Using workspace directory as project root: /workspace"
       if ! cd "/workspace"; then
           echo "Error: Cannot change to workspace directory: /workspace"
           exit 1
       fi
   else
       echo "Warning: Using current directory as project root: $(pwd)"
   fi

   echo "Operating from directory: $(pwd)"
   ```

**Parse user directive (if provided):**

1. **Extract directive context:**
   - If command includes text after `/fix`, capture as directive
   - Parse directive to identify target patterns and fix types
   - Store directive context for use in categorization step
   - Log interpreted directive scope for transparency

**Verify environment and establish baseline:**

1. **Verify check script exists:**
   - Check for existence of `./check.sh` in repository root
   - If not found, check for alternative locations:
     - `find . -maxdepth 2 -name "check.sh" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -5`
   - If no check script exists, report error and exit

2. **Run check script:**

   ```bash
   ./check.sh
   ```

   - Parse output to identify issue patterns
   - Identify warnings and errors to be fixed
   - Generate implementation strategy for fixes

**Decision point:**

- **If check passes completely** (exit code 0 AND no output except success messages): Report success, exit
- **If check finds ANY issues** (ANY output including diffs, warnings, errors, regardless of exit code):
  Continue to Step 2

**IMPORTANT - Reading Bash Tool Results:**

The Bash tool results tell you the exit code without needing to re-run:

- **Exit code 0**: Function results have NO `<error>` tag
- **Exit code non-zero**: Function results have an `<error>` tag
- **NEVER re-run `./check.sh` just to verify the exit code** - you already know it from the tool results

**CRITICAL WARNING - CASCADING CHECK FAILURES**:

- **Earlier failing checks PREVENT later checks from running** (e.g., if compilation fails, linting cannot run)
- **Fixing visible errors is NOT sufficient** - earlier failures mask later issues
- **Each iteration may reveal COMPLETELY NEW issues** that were hidden by previous failures
- **You must run `./check.sh` after EVERY fix** to discover newly exposed issues
- **Only when `./check.sh` runs COMPLETELY through ALL checks with NO output is the job done**

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: ANY output from `./check.sh` (including formatting diffs) indicates issues that MUST be
fixed. Empty output or success-only messages are the ONLY indicators of a truly clean state.

### Step 2: Issue Categorization and Triage

**Parse check output and classify each issue:**

#### Trivial Issues (Auto-Fixable)

Issues that can be safely fixed without changing code behavior:

- **Formatting violations**: Indentation, spacing, line length, **ANY formatting diffs shown by check tools**
- **Import organization**: Ordering, grouping, unused imports
- **Whitespace issues**: Trailing spaces, missing newlines, blank lines
- **Style consistency**: Quote styles, comma placement, semicolons
- **Documentation formatting**: Comment style, docstring format (not content)
- **Simple type annotations**: Missing annotations that can be inferred
- **File encoding**: BOM markers, line ending consistency

**KEY INSIGHT**: If `./check.sh` shows formatting diffs (like `cargo fmt` or `prettier` output),
these are trivial formatting violations that MUST be fixed by running the appropriate formatter.

#### Serious Issues (Require Human Review)

Issues that require judgment or may change behavior:

- **Logic errors**: Potential bugs, undefined behavior
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Injection risks, authentication flaws
- **Performance problems**: Algorithm complexity, resource leaks
- **Architecture violations**: Design pattern breaks, coupling issues
- **Complex type errors**: Requiring structural refactoring
- **Test failures**: Broken functionality, assertion errors
- **Missing documentation**: Required content, API descriptions
- **Deprecated usage**: APIs requiring migration
- **Dependency issues**: Version conflicts, missing packages
- **Database/API changes**: Schema modifications, contract violations

**Categorization rules:**

```text
For each issue in check output:
  Extract: file, line, column, message, severity

  # First check against directive (if provided)
  If user_directive exists:
    If issue matches directive pattern:
      If fix is deterministic and safe:
        Mark as auto-fixable (directive-enabled)
        Continue to next issue

  # Standard categorization
  Match against trivial patterns first
  If matches trivial AND NOT matches serious:
    Mark as auto-fixable (standard)
  Else:
    Mark for human review
```

#### Directive-Based Categorization

When a directive is provided, expand the "trivial" category to include such tasks as:

**API/Method Updates** (if directive mentions API changes):

- Type errors caused by known API signature changes
- Method calls using old signatures that have clear new equivalents
- Parameter order changes with deterministic fixes

**Deprecation Fixes** (if directive mentions deprecated patterns):

- Deprecated method calls with documented replacements
- Old syntax patterns with modern equivalents
- Legacy imports that map to new modules

**Syntax Modernization** (if directive mentions modernization):

- Variable declarations (var -> let/const)
- Function expressions -> arrow functions (where appropriate)
- String concatenation -> template literals
- Callback patterns -> async/await (where safe)

**Type Annotations** (if directive mentions types):

- Missing return types that can be inferred
- Parameter types obvious from usage
- Generic type parameters with clear constraints

**Import Transformations** (if directive mentions imports):

- CommonJS -> ES6 modules
- Relative -> absolute imports (with clear mapping)
- Default -> named exports (where unambiguous)

### Step 3: Iterative Fix Loop

**Continue while progress is being made:**

#### a) Apply Automated Fixes

For each category of trivial issues:

1. **Select appropriate tool:**
   - **Python**: `black`, `isort`, `autopep8`
   - **JavaScript/TypeScript**: `eslint --fix`, `prettier`
   - **Rust**: `rustfmt`, `clippy --fix`
   - **Go**: `gofmt`, `goimports`
   - **Generic**: sed/awk for simple patterns -- NO WILDCARDS

   If no tool exists for the issue identified, or if the appropriate tool is not accessible, fall back to manual
   fixes. Use targeted file edits for each fix -- NEVER regenerate a complete file.

2. **Apply fixes conservatively:**

   ```bash
   # Example for Python formatting
   black --quiet affected_file.py
   isort --quiet affected_file.py

   # Example for JavaScript
   eslint --fix affected_file.js

   # Verify syntax after each fix
   python -m py_compile affected_file.py  # or appropriate validator
   ```

3. **Track changes made:**
   - Log each file modified
   - Record type of fix applied
   - Count issues resolved

#### b) Verify Progress

After applying fixes:

```bash
./check.sh
```

**Interpreting Bash Tool Results:**

- **NO `<error>` tag in results + empty output**: Exit code 0, all checks passed, DONE
- **NO `<error>` tag in results + any output**: Exit code 0 but issues remain, CONTINUE
- **`<error>` tag in results**: Exit code non-zero, issues remain, CONTINUE
- **NEVER re-run commands just to verify the exit code** - the tool results already tell you

**Progress evaluation:**

- **Diff output**: Formatting diffs indicate trivial issues requiring `cargo fmt`, `prettier`, `black`, etc.
- **Any output**: Warnings, suggestions, or diffs all indicate remaining work
- **Recurring issues**: Check for same file:line:message appearing repeatedly
- **Fix cycles**: Detect issues reappearing after being fixed
- **Clean state**: ONLY achieved when `./check.sh` produces no output and exits 0

#### c) Loop Control - MANDATORY ITERATION UNTIL COMPLETE SILENCE

**YOU MUST CONTINUE ITERATING** if ANY of these conditions are true:

- **ANY output from `./check.sh` exists** (diffs, warnings, errors, suggestions - ANYTHING)
- Exit code is non-zero
- New fixable issues discovered in output
- Previous fixes may have enabled detection of new issues (CASCADING FAILURES)

**STOP ONLY when ALL of these conditions are met SIMULTANEOUSLY:**

- `./check.sh` exits with code 0
- `./check.sh` produces NO output (completely empty stdout/stderr) OR only explicit success messages
- NO formatting diffs are shown
- NO warnings or errors are reported
- NO suggestions or recommendations
- The script runs COMPLETELY through ALL its checks

**CASCADING CHECK FAILURE PATTERN - WHY YOU MUST KEEP ITERATING:**

1. **First run**: Compilation fails, stops early, shows only compiler errors
2. **After fixing compilation**: Linter can now run, reveals 50+ style violations
3. **After fixing style**: Tests can now run, reveals 3 test failures
4. **After fixing tests**: Security scanner can now run, finds 2 vulnerabilities
5. **After fixing security**: Performance checks reveal optimization opportunities
6. **Only now**: `./check.sh` runs completely silent - job complete

**CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING - NEVER STOP EARLY:**

- **Merely fixing visible errors is WRONG** - you've only cleared the first layer
- **Each fix may reveal completely new categories of issues** that couldn't run before
- **"No more errors of type X" != "all checks passed"** - other check types may not have run yet
- **Complete silence is the ONLY success condition** - anything else means hidden issues remain
- **Exit code 0 alone means NOTHING** - the script may have exited early due to failures

### Step 4: Safety Mechanisms

**File protection rules:**

Never modify these paths:

```text
.git/              # Git internals
node_modules/      # Package dependencies
vendor/            # Vendor dependencies
venv/             # Virtual environments
*.min.js          # Minified files
*.bundle.*        # Bundle files
/tmp/             # Temporary files
```

**Change validation:**

After each fix:

1. Verify file syntax remains valid
2. Check no new errors introduced

### Step 5: Report Results

**Success**: "Fixed all trivial issues. `./check.sh` exits cleanly with no output - completely clean
state achieved."

**Partial**: "Fixed trivial issues but work remains. `./check.sh` still shows output requiring
manual review: [brief list of remaining issue types with sample output]"

**Failure**: "Failed to make progress: [error reason]. `./check.sh` output unchanged after fixes attempted."

**IMPORTANT**: Only report success when `./check.sh` produces NO visible output (or only explicit
success messages) AND exits with code 0. Any remaining diffs, warnings, or suggestions mean the job
is incomplete.

## Operating Principles

### Autonomy and Boundaries

- **Autonomous operation**: Proceed through iterations without user interaction after initial start
- **Conservative fixing**: Only fix issues with 100% confidence of safety
- **Stop on uncertainty**: Halt immediately when encountering ambiguous issues
- **Preserve correctness**: Never modify code logic or behavior
- **Report everything**: Document all changes and decisions

### Fix Priority Order

1. **Syntax errors** preventing parsing (if trivial)
2. **Formatting** for consistency
3. **Imports** organization and cleanup
4. **Whitespace** normalization
5. **Style** consistency issues
6. **Documentation** formatting and spelling typos only

### Quality Assurance

After each iteration verify:

- No new errors introduced
- File syntax remains valid
- No functional changes made

## Error Handling

- Capture full error output
- Check for missing dependencies
- Report error with context

## Important Notes

- **No git operations**: Never stage, commit, or push changes
- **Preserve user control**: User decides what to do with fixes
- **Conservative approach**: When in doubt, don't fix
- **Clear boundaries**: Only mechanical fixes, no logic changes
- **Complete transparency**: Report every change made
- **Respect project style**: Use project-specific tools when available
- **Safe failures**: Always leave code in working state
- **No configuration changes**: Don't modify tool configs or project settings
- **NEVER disable tests**: Don't skip or disable a test to get it to "pass"

## Success Criteria

The workflow succeeds when **ALL** of these conditions are met **SIMULTANEOUSLY**:

- **Check script exits with code 0** (process success)
- **COMPLETE SILENCE from `./check.sh`** (empty stdout/stderr OR only explicit success messages)
- **Script runs ALL THE WAY THROUGH** (not stopped early by failures)
- **NO formatting diffs displayed** (no `cargo fmt` style output showing changes needed)
- **NO warnings, errors, or suggestions** (completely clean validation)
- **NO "fixed X issues, Y remaining" messages** (all issues resolved)
- **All trivial issues resolved** (nothing remaining for automated fixes)
- **Clear report generated** (documenting what was fixed)
- **No files broken by fixes** (syntax and functionality preserved)
- **All changes documented** (complete transparency)

## CRITICAL WARNING: Why Agents Fail This Workflow

**COMMON FAILURE PATTERN:**

1. **Early termination:**
   - Agent sees compiler errors, fixes them
   - Agent re-runs `./check.sh`, sees fewer errors
   - Agent thinks "good progress!" and reports partial success
   - **WRONG** - all errors need to be fixed

2. **Incomplete verification:**
   - Agent sees compiler errors, fixes them
   - Agent runs `cargo check` instead of `./check.sh`, sees no errors
   - Agent thinks "mission accomplished!" and reports total success
   - **WRONG** - the script may not have run e.g. linter, formatter, tests, or security checks yet

**CORRECT UNDERSTANDING:**

- **Early termination hides later checks** - fixing syntax allows linter to run for first time
- **Each layer of fixes exposes new layers** - like peeling an onion
- **"Fewer errors" != "all checks complete"** - you may have only unlocked new error categories
- **Only COMPLETE SILENCE indicates all checks ran successfully**

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS FOR SUCCESS:**

1. **Run `./check.sh` after EVERY single fix** - no exceptions
2. **Continue until ZERO output** - any text means issues remain
3. **Verify the script completes fully** - not just that it starts successfully
4. **Never report success with ANY remaining output** - this is the #1 failure mode

**The workflow is NOT complete until `./check.sh` produces completely silent output and runs ALL checks to completion.**

## Failure Modes

The workflow fails when:

- Check script cannot be found or run
- No progress after multiple iterations

**These rules are non-negotiable and apply to all AI agent interactions using this workflow.**
