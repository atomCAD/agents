# Git Commit Message Generation Autonomous Workflow Action

You are a git commit message generator responsible for creating high-quality commit messages that
accurately describe staged changes and follow project conventions. You analyze staged changes
comprehensively, generate appropriate messages using specialized agents, validate the results against
project guidelines, and ensure messages are ready for immediate commit use. You operate fully
autonomously without user interaction.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Verify Staged Changes

Check for staged changes to analyze:

1. Check staged changes:
   - Run `git diff --staged --stat` to get summary of staged changes
   - If outputs is empty, no changes are staged

2. Decision point:
   - If staged changes exist (non-empty output): Continue to Step 2
   - If no staged changes (empty output):
     - Report error: "No changes are currently staged for message generation."
     - Run `git status` to show current repository status for context
     - Suggest staging commands: `/stage` or manual `git add`
     - **EXIT WORKFLOW IMMEDIATELY** with failure status

**Example output for no staged changes:**

```text
Error: No changes are currently staged for message generation.

Current status:
{output of git status}

To stage changes for commit message generation:
- Use `/stage <description>` for intelligent staging
- Use `git add <file>` for specific files
- Use `git add -p` for interactive staging

Exiting message generation workflow.
```

### Step 2: Analyze Repository Context

Gather context for message generation:

1. Collect repository information:
   - Get recent commit history: `git log --format=full -10`
   - Read project guidelines from `.claude/guidelines/git-commit-messages.md` (if exists)
   - Get branch information: `git branch --show-current`

2. Prepare change analysis:
   - File change summary: `git diff --staged --stat`
   - Complete diff content: `git diff --staged`
   - **CRITICAL**: Ensure complete diff analysis, not just first 100 lines
   - Identify change patterns and scope

3. Determine message type:
   - New commit: Standard message generation
   - Amending commit (if `git log -1 --format=%s` matches existing message):
     - Analyze existing commit: `git show HEAD`
     - Combine with new staged changes for comprehensive message

### Step 3: Check for Existing Commit Message

Check if `.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG` already exists and determine how to proceed:

1. **Check for existing commit message file:**
   - Read `.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG` if it exists
   - If file doesn't exist: Continue to Step 4 for standard message generation

2. **If existing message found, determine relevance:**
   - **Relevance check**: Does the existing message describe the current staged changes?
     - Compare key terms in message with staged file names and diff content
     - Look for alignment between message components (e.g., 'auth:' prefix with auth files changed)
     - Check if message scope matches staged change scope

3. **Decision point based on relevance AND user directive:**

   **Case A: No user directive provided**
   - **If message describes current changes (relevant)**: Skip generation, proceed to Step 5 (validation)
   - **Otherwise**: Continue to Step 4 (regenerate)

   **Case B: User directive provided (e.g., `/message <description>`)**
   - **Always continue to Step 4** to incorporate user directive
   - Pass both existing message and user directive to commit-message-author
   - Agent should improve/modify existing message according to user's guidance

**CRITICAL: Document decision made:** Log which path was taken and why - this helps with debugging workflow behavior.

**Example decision logic:**

<good-example>
**Example 1: No existing commit message**

Command: `/message`

Logged decision output:

```text
Checking for existing commit message...
No .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG file found

Decision: No existing message to evaluate
Action: Generating new commit message for staged changes
```

</good-example>

<good-example>
**Example 2: No user directive, message describes current changes**

Command: `/message`

Logged decision output:

```text
Checking for existing commit message...
Found: "error: add structured YAML error reporting with correlation IDs"

Analyzing staged changes:
- .claude/libs/error.sh (+175 lines): error_report() function, correlation IDs
- .claude/tests/error-core.sh (+349 lines): comprehensive test coverage

Relevance check:
Existing message describes "structured YAML error reporting"
Staged changes add error reporting functionality to error.sh and tests
Assessment: Message matches staged changes

Decision: Existing message appears to describe staged changes
Action: Using existing message, proceeding to validation
```

</good-example>

<good-example>
**Example 3: No user directive, message describes different changes**

Command: `/message`

Logged decision output:

```text
Checking for existing commit message...
Found: "parser: fix JSON null handling in recursive descent"

Analyzing staged changes:
- src/auth/jwt.js (+85 lines): JWT token validation improvements
- src/auth/middleware.js (+32 lines): authentication middleware updates
- tests/auth/jwt.test.js (+156 lines): comprehensive JWT testing

Relevance check:
Existing message describes "JSON null handling in recursive descent"
Staged changes modify JWT authentication and middleware files
Assessment: Message describes completely different functionality

Decision: Existing message describes unrelated changes
Action: Generating new message for current JWT authentication changes
```

</good-example>

<good-example>
**Example 4: User directive provided**

Command: `/message make it more concise and focus on practical benefits`

Logged decision output:

```text
Checking for existing commit message...
Found: "error: add structured YAML error reporting with correlation IDs..."
(62 lines total - very detailed technical implementation)

User directive: "make it more concise and focus on practical benefits"

Decision: User wants to improve existing message regardless of relevance
Action: Passing existing message and user directive to commit-message-author
Instructions: Keep technical accuracy but make more concise and highlight practical value
```

</good-example>

### Step 4: Generate Commit Message

Call specialized agent to create commit message:

1. Call commit-message-author agent with comprehensive context:

   ```text
   Context:
   - Operation type: [new commit OR amending existing commit OR improving existing message]
   - If amending:
     - Existing commit details: [output of git show HEAD]
     - New staged changes: [output of git diff --staged]
   - If improving existing message:
     - Existing message: [content from .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG]
     - User directive: [user's guidance for improvement]
     - Staged changes: [complete diff from git diff --staged]
   - If new commit:
     - Staged changes: [complete diff from git diff --staged]
   - Recent commit history: [last 10 commits for style consistency]
   - Project guidelines: [content from guidelines file or note if absent]
   - Change statistics: [files changed, insertions, deletions]
   - Branch context: [current branch name]

   CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
   - Analyze the ENTIRE diff comprehensively, never truncate
   - For amending: Consider both existing commit and new staged changes
   - For improving: Use existing message as foundation, apply user directive
   - Use location-based component prefixes (e.g., 'auth:', 'parser:'), NOT type prefixes
   - Follow project-specific conventions from guidelines
   - Never include tool advertisements or automated signatures
   - Use imperative mood in subject line
   - Keep subject line under 50 characters (hard limit: 72)
   - Wrap body text at 72 characters
   - Include detailed explanation for complex changes

   Request:
   [If improving existing message]
   Improve the existing commit message according to the user's directive:
   - Keep what works well from the existing message
   - Apply the user's requested changes or improvements
   - Ensure the result accurately describes the staged changes
   - Maintain consistency with project conventions

   [If generating new message]
   Generate a commit message that:
   - Clearly explains what changes were made
   - Explains why these changes were necessary
   - Uses consistent style with project history
   - References related issues or tickets if apparent
   - Provides context for future developers
   ```

2. Process agent response:
   - Extract generated commit message
   - Ensure proper formatting is preserved
   - Check for any agent errors or warnings

3. Save initial commit message:
   - Write the generated commit message to `.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG`
   - Verify the file was written correctly

### Step 5: Iterative Validation and Correction Loop

**CRITICAL: Call ALL selected agents in a SINGLE message with multiple tool calls for parallel execution:**

Execute comprehensive validation with specialist-driven corrections:

**VALIDATION CYCLE (repeat until all agents pass):**

1. **Run markdownlint validation first:**
   - Run `cd .git && markdownlint-cli2 COMMIT_EDITMSG --config ../.claude/config/commit-message.markdownlint-cli2.yaml`
   - If markdownlint reports any issues:
     - Apply automatic fixes for common markdown formatting issues
     - Update `.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG` with corrected content
     - Re-run markdownlint validation to verify fixes
     - Repeat up to 5 times until no issues remain or maximum attempts reached
     - If still failing after 5 attempts, exit with markdownlint error details
   - If no issues found, proceed to next step
   - This validation ensures commit messages follow markdown best practices for readability

2. **Execute all validation agents in parallel:**
   - **commit-message-accuracy-checker**: Verifies message claims match actual code changes
   - **commit-message-format-checker**: Validates formatting, line lengths, imperative mood, whitespace
   - **commit-message-guidelines-checker**: Applies project-specific guidelines and conventions
   - **commit-message-nit-checker**: Checks consistency with project history, flags prohibited attribution

   **CRITICAL**: Generate all tool calls in a single message for parallel execution.

3. **Cycle Decision Point:**
   - **If ALL validation agents pass AND markdownlint passes**: Continue to Step 6 (save and report)
   - **If ANY validation agents report issues OR markdownlint fails**: Continue to step 4 (issue resolution)

4. **Issue Analysis and Validation (for ALL identified issues):**
   - **Launch Opus specialist agent for each reported issue** (in parallel):
     - Pass the validation agent's report and the current commit message
     - Specialist determines: Is this issue real? What specific corrective action is needed?
     - Specialist provides detailed remediation guidance or dismisses false positives
   - **Consolidate ALL specialist recommendations** into actionable corrections

5. **Issue Correction (for ALL validated issues):**
   - **Apply ALL trivial corrections** (formatting, whitespace, simple text changes) directly
     - **Update `.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG`** with fully corrected message
   - **For ALL complex corrections** (message structure, content accuracy, style changes):
     - Call commit-message-author with ALL correction instructions consolidated
     - Include original message, all issue details, and all required changes

6. **Return to Validation Cycle:**
   - **Return to start of validation cycle** (re-execute all validation agents on the corrected message)
   - **Maximum 5 validation cycles** to prevent infinite loops
   - **If still failing after 5 cycles**: Exit with detailed error report

**Example correction cycle:**

```text
Cycle 1: Format agent finds subject too long -> Specialist confirms -> Call commit-message-author to shorten
Cycle 2: Markdownlint finds formatting issues -> Apply automatic fixes -> Update COMMIT_EDITMSG
Cycle 3: Accuracy agent finds technical claim incorrect -> Specialist confirms -> Call commit-message-author to correct
Cycle 4: All agents pass and markdownlint passes -> Proceed to Step 6
```

### Step 6: Report Results

Provide comprehensive report on the completed message generation:

1. Generate success report:

   ```text
   Message Generation Complete

   Generated Message:
   ---------------------
   [Subject line]

   [Body content if any]
   ---------------------

   Validation Results:
   [x] Format: Subject <=50 chars, body wrapped at 72
   [x] Style: Imperative mood, proper grammar
   [x] Guidelines: Follows project conventions
   [x] Relevance: Accurately describes staged changes

   Files Analyzed:
   - [list of staged files with change summary]

   Statistics:
   - [X files changed, Y insertions, Z deletions]

   Message saved to .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG
   Ready for commit with: `/commit`
   ```

2. Error reporting (if validation fails):

   ```text
   Message Generation Failed

   Error:
   [Specific validation failure details]

   Attempted Fixes:
   - [List of regeneration attempts made]

   Staged Changes:
   - [Summary of changes that couldn't be properly described]

   Suggestions:
   1. Check if staged changes are coherent and atomic
   2. Verify project guidelines in .claude/guidelines/git-commit-messages.md
   3. Consider staging fewer changes for a more focused message
   ```

## Validation Framework

### Message Quality Standards

- Subject must not end with period
- Blank line between subject and body (if body exists)
- Body lines wrapped at 72 characters
- No trailing whitespace on any line

#### Content Requirements

- Subject uses imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Subject starts with capital letter
- Body explains "what" and "why", not just "how"
- Technical terms used accurately
- References to files/functions use correct names

#### Project Integration

- Consistent with recent commit message style
- Uses appropriate component prefixes for changed areas
- Includes required metadata (issue numbers, co-authors) per guidelines
- Follows any project-specific conventions

### Validation Levels

#### Level 4 - Change Relevance

- Accuracy of described modifications
- No mention of unstaged changes
- Proper scope matching

## Operating Principles

### Autonomous Operations

This is a fully autonomous API command that operates without user interaction:

1. Automatic decisions:
   - Analyze all staged changes comprehensively
   - Generate message following project conventions
   - Validate against multiple quality criteria
   - Save only when message meets all standards

2. No user interaction:
   - No confirmations required
   - No iterative refinement with user
   - Complete in single execution cycle

3. Operations performed:
   - Check for staged changes availability
   - Gather repository context and guidelines
   - Generate message using specialized agent
   - Validate message comprehensively
   - Save to .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG for commit use
   - Return structured success/failure response

### Conservative Message Generation

- When changes are complex, provide detailed explanations
- When changes span multiple concerns, note the relationship
- Prefer clear, specific descriptions over generic summaries
- Include context that helps future developers understand intent
- Maintain atomic commit message principles
- Reference related changes when they provide important context

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

No staged changes:

- Verify staging area state with `git diff --staged`
- Check if working directory has unstaged changes
- Provide clear staging guidance to user

Message generation failures:

- Capture agent errors and timeouts
- Retry with restated and clarified context if initial attempt fails (maximum 3 attempts)
- Provide specific error context for debugging
- Fail immediately if commit-message-author agent is unavailable

Validation failures:

- Report specific validation rule violations
- Include examples of correct format when applicable
- Suggest fixes for common issues

File system issues:

- Handle `.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG` write permissions
- Check for disk space before saving
- Verify git repository integrity

### Recovery Procedures

For generation failures:

1. Capture exact error from commit-message-author agent
2. Retry with restated and clarified context (maximum 3 attempts)
3. Exit with detailed error report if all attempts fail

For validation failures:

1. Document specific validation rule violations
2. Attempt regeneration with validation feedback
3. Maximum 3 regeneration attempts to prevent loops
4. Provide specific guidance for manual message creation

For file system issues:

1. Check git repository state and permissions
2. Verify `.git` directory structure integrity
3. Report specific I/O errors with suggested fixes
4. Never leave corrupted or partial message files

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Feature Implementation Message

```text
User: /message
Assistant: Analyzing staged changes...

Found 4 staged files with modifications:
- src/auth/jwt.js (new functionality)
- src/middleware/auth.js (integration)
- tests/auth/jwt.test.js (test coverage)
- docs/api/authentication.md (documentation)

Generating commit message...

Message Generation Complete

Generated Message:
------------------
auth: add JWT token refresh mechanism

Implement automatic token refresh for expired JWTs to improve
user experience by preventing forced re-authentication during
active sessions.

- Add RefreshTokenService with secure token rotation
- Integrate refresh logic into existing auth middleware
- Include comprehensive test coverage for edge cases
- Update API documentation with new endpoint details

Closes #156
------------------

Validation Results:
[x] Format: Subject 47 chars, body wrapped at 72
[x] Style: Imperative mood, clear explanation
[x] Guidelines: Uses 'auth:' prefix, includes issue reference
[x] Relevance: Accurately describes all staged changes

Message saved to .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG
Ready for commit with: `/commit`
```

### Example 2: Bug Fix Message

```text
User: /message
Assistant: Analyzing staged changes...

Found 2 staged files:
- src/parser/json.js (bug fix)
- tests/parser/json.test.js (regression test)

Generating commit message...

Message Generation Complete

Generated Message:
---------------------
parser: fix null pointer exception in nested object parsing

Handle edge case where deeply nested JSON objects with null
values caused parser to throw unhandled exceptions instead
of gracefully processing the null values.

- Add null safety checks in recursive parsing logic
- Include regression test for nested null scenarios
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing parsing behavior
---------------------

Validation Results:
[x] Format: Subject 49 chars, body wrapped at 68
[x] Style: Clear problem and solution description
[x] Guidelines: Component prefix matches changed files
[x] Relevance: Describes exact fix implemented

Message saved to .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG
Ready for commit with: `/commit`
```

### Example 3: Validation Failure

```text
User: /message
Assistant: Analyzing staged changes...

Found 8 staged files across multiple modules:
- src/auth/ (3 files)
- src/database/ (2 files)
- src/ui/ (2 files)
- config/settings.js (1 file)

Generating commit message...

Message Generation Failed

Error:
Generated message failed validation - changes span unrelated concerns
that should be committed separately for clearer project history.

Change Analysis:
- Authentication improvements (login/logout functionality)
- Database migration scripts (schema updates)
- UI styling updates (button components)
- Configuration changes (API endpoints)

Suggestions:
1. Stage authentication changes only: git reset HEAD && git add src/auth/
2. Create separate commits for database, UI, and config changes
3. Use `/stage` command to selectively stage related changes

Each concern should have its own focused commit message.
```

## Important Notes

- **Fully autonomous**: No user interaction required during generation
- **Comprehensive analysis**: Always examines complete staged diff, never truncated
- **Quality assurance**: Multiple validation layers ensure message quality
- **Project integration**: Respects guidelines and maintains style consistency
- **Ready for commit**: Generated messages are immediately usable with `/commit`
- **Error transparency**: Clear reporting when generation or validation fails
- **Safe operations**: Never modifies staged changes, only analyzes and generates messages
- **Amend awareness**: Handles amending commits by combining existing and new changes

**These rules are non-negotiable and apply to all AI agent interactions using this workflow.**
