## Implementation Best Practices

### Semantic HTML and ARIA Guidelines

**Core Principle:** Always use semantic HTML elements first. Only add ARIA when semantic options don't exist.

```html
<!-- Good: Semantic button -->
<button type="submit">Submit Form</button>

<!-- Avoid: DIV with ARIA when button exists -->
<div role="button" tabindex="0">Submit Form</div>
```

ARIA Role Usage:

- Apply roles only when no semantic HTML element exists for the purpose
- Common patterns: `dialog`, `alert`, `navigation` (when not using `<nav>`)
- Never add redundant roles on semantic elements (e.g., `role="button"` on `<button>`)

ARIA States and Properties:

- `aria-label`: Accessible name when visible text insufficient
- `aria-labelledby`: Reference to labeling element(s)
- `aria-describedby`: Additional descriptive information
- `aria-expanded`: State for collapsible content
- `aria-hidden`: Hide decorative content from screen readers
- `aria-current`: Indicate current item in a set
- `aria-selected`: State for selectable items
- `aria-checked`: State for checkable items
- `aria-disabled`: Indicate disabled state
- `aria-invalid`: Mark invalid form inputs
- `aria-required`: Indicate required form fields
- `aria-multiselectable`: Allow multiple selections
- `aria-orientation`: Specify widget orientation
- `aria-controls`: Identify controlled elements
- `aria-owns`: Define parent-child relationships
- `aria-activedescendant`: Manage focus in composite widgets

Live Regions:

- `aria-live="polite"`: Announces when user is idle
- `aria-live="assertive"`: Interrupts to announce immediately
- `aria-atomic="true"`: Announce entire region content
- `aria-relevant`: Specify what changes to announce
- Use sparingly and test thoroughly

### Advanced ARIA Widget Patterns

Common Widget Patterns to Test:

- **Accordions:** Verify aria-expanded state, aria-controls relationships, and keyboard navigation
- **Tab Panels:** Check role="tab" and role="tabpanel", aria-selected states, arrow key navigation
- **Tree Views:** Validate treeitem roles, aria-expanded for folders, arrow key navigation
- **Data Grids:** Use grid role only for spreadsheet-like interfaces with cell navigation
- **Modals:** Ensure role="dialog", aria-modal="true", focus trapping, and escape key handling

For detailed implementation patterns, refer to the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG).

### Form Accessibility

Implementation Requirements:

```html
<!-- Proper labeling and error handling -->
<label for="email">Email Address (required)</label>
<input type="email" id="email" required aria-describedby="email-error">
<div id="email-error" aria-live="polite" class="error"></div>

<!-- Group related fields -->
<fieldset>
  <legend>Contact Information</legend>
  <!-- grouped form fields -->
</fieldset>
```

### Focus Management

Focus Indicators:

- Minimum 3:1 contrast ratio against adjacent colors
- Clearly visible and consistent across all interactive elements
- Non-color indicators (outline, border) for color-blind users

Focus Trapping:

- Implement for modal dialogs
- Return focus to trigger element on close
- Provide clear escape mechanisms

Focus Management Testing Points:

- **Single Page Applications:** Verify focus moves to new content on route changes and page title updates
- **Modal Dialogs:** Test focus trap implementation and return to trigger element on close
- **Dynamic Content:** Ensure focus position is maintained when content updates
- **Keyboard Traps:** Verify Escape key and other exit mechanisms work
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Check that core functionality works without JavaScript

## Tool Usage for Accessibility Testing

### Code Analysis Patterns

Desktop Application Accessibility Patterns:

```bash
# Windows WPF accessibility issues
grep -r 'AutomationProperties' . --include="*.xaml" | grep -v 'Name\|HelpText'

# Missing keyboard navigation in Electron apps
grep -r 'addEventListener.*click' . --include="*.js" | grep -v 'keydown\|keyup'

# Qt applications missing accessible names
grep -r 'QWidget\|QPushButton\|QLabel' . --include="*.cpp" | grep -v 'setAccessible'

# GTK apps without ATK properties
grep -r 'gtk_widget_new\|gtk_button_new' . --include="*.c" | grep -v 'atk_object'

# Java Swing missing accessible descriptions
grep -r 'JButton\|JTextField' . --include="*.java" | grep -v 'getAccessibleContext'
```

Image Accessibility Issues:

```bash
# Find images missing alt attributes entirely
grep -r '<img(?![^>]*alt=)' . --include="*.html"

# Find empty alt without decorative role (likely an error)
grep -r 'alt=""' . | grep -v 'role="presentation"'

# Find generic/placeholder alt text that needs improvement
grep -r 'alt="image\|photo\|picture\|graphic"' . --include="*.html"
```

Form Accessibility Issues:

```bash
# Find input fields without proper labeling
grep -r '<input' . | grep -v 'aria-label\|aria-labelledby\|type="hidden\|type="submit"'

# Find labels not associated with form controls
grep -r '<label' . | grep -v 'for='

# Find required fields missing ARIA attribute
grep -r 'required' . --include="*.html" | grep -v 'aria-required'
```

ARIA and Keyboard Access Issues:

```bash
# Find elements with button role but no keyboard access
grep -r 'role="button"' . | grep -v 'tabindex'

# Find positive tabindex values (disrupts natural tab order)
grep -r 'tabindex="[1-9]' . --include="*.html"

# Find click handlers without keyboard equivalents
grep -r 'onclick=' . | grep -v 'onkey\|button\|<a'
```

Structure and Semantic Issues:

```bash
# Find clickable divs that should be buttons
grep -r '<div.*onclick' . --include="*.html" | grep -v 'role='

# Check heading hierarchy for skipped levels
grep -r '<h[1-6]' . --include="*.html" | sort | uniq

# Find data tables missing captions
grep -r '<table' . | grep -v 'caption\|aria-label\|role="presentation"'
```

### Essential Pattern Detection

Key Accessibility Issues to Search For:

```bash
# Images without alt text
grep -r '<img(?![^>]*alt=)' . --include="*.html"

# Forms without labels
grep -r '<input' . | grep -v 'aria-label\|aria-labelledby\|type="hidden\|type="submit"'

# Positive tabindex (disrupts natural tab order)
grep -r 'tabindex="[1-9]' . --include="*.html"

# Click handlers without keyboard support
grep -r 'onclick=' . | grep -v 'onkey\|button\|<a'

# Missing heading hierarchy
grep -r '<h[1-6]' . --include="*.html" | sort | uniq
```
